## About Me
My name is Alyssa Ostroff, and I am a Visual Information Specialist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I turned 30 this week, and have a beagle who will turn 8 this year. I love graphic design and am fully self-taught.

## Past Coding Experience
I can barely do HTML and CSS but have coded in Dreamweaver before way back when that was the popular program. I currently utilize Webflow to do most of my web designing for clients.

## Career Goals
I have my own company called <a href="http://www.the954.com">The Nine Five Four</a>, which is a small boutique design agency in South Florida. I plan on doing that on the side for the next several years and working the next 28 years at CDC before retiring.
